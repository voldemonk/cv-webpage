    title: About
    summary: |
        Hi everyone! I will soon be starting a post-doctoral position in [Charles University](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en/iuuk) with 
        [Michal Kouck√Ω](https://iuuk.mff.cuni.cz/~koucky/). Prior to this I was a post-doctoral researcher in the [Algorithms and Complexity](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/research/themes/algorithms-and-complexity) group at the University of Cambridge, as well as the 
        [Theory and Foundations](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/focs/) group and the [Centre for Discrete Mathematics 
        and its Applications (DIMAP)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/dimap/) at the University of Warwick, hosted by [Tom Gur](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/tg508) 
        (in both places).

        My research interests are broadly in Computational Complexity Theory. In particular, I am currently interested in <b>computational 
        learning theory, interactive proof systems, circuit complexity, meta-complexity, and pseudorandomness</b>.

        I did my D.Phil at the [Algorithms and Complexity Theory](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/research/algorithms/) 
        group in the University of Oxford, advised by [Rahul Santhanam](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/rahul.santhanam/). Before 
        this, I did my Master's degree at the [Computer Science and Automation](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/) department in the 
        Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, and my undergraduate degree was at the 
        [Computer Science](https://sjce.ac.in/dept/cs/) department in Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering (SJCE), Mysuru.
