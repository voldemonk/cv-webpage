    title: About
    summary: |
        Hi everyone! I am a post-doctoral researcher in the [Algorithms and Complexity](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/research/themes/algorithms-and-complexity) 
        group at the University of Cambridge, where I am fortunate to be hosted by [Tom Gur](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/tg508). I also am a visiting researcher
        in the [Theory and Foundations](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/focs/) group and the 
        [Centre for Discrete Mathematics and its Applications (DIMAP)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/dimap/) at the University of Warwick, where I was a post-doctoral researcher previously. 
        
        I did my D.Phil at the [Algorithms and Complexity Theory](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/research/algorithms/) group in the University of Oxford, advised by 
        [Rahul Santhanam](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/rahul.santhanam/). Before this, I did my Master's degree at the 
        [Computer Science and Automation](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/) department in the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, and my undergraduate degree was at the 
        [Computer Science](https://sjce.ac.in/dept/cs/) department in Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering (SJCE), Mysuru.

        My research interests are mainly in Computational Complexity Theory. In particular, I am currently interested in <b>computational 
        learning theory, interactive proof systems, circuit complexity, meta-complexity, pseudorandomness</b>, and <b>combinatorics</b>.

        You can find my DBLP page [here](https://dblp.org/pid/129/9004.html).
